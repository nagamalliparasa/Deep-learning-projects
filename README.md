This repository is created to showcase of my work using deep learning technology 


Deep learing models that I had already focused:

1. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) 
3. Recurrent Neural Netwoks (RNN)
4. Long short term memory (LSTM)
5. Gated Recurrent units (GRU)
6. Transformers 
7. Generative Adversial Networks (GANs)
